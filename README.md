### Hi, I'm Andy

I am a software engineer. I have passion for technology, healthy curiosity, and take great satisfaction in making things work. 

I have experience across a broad range of technologies and industries, and provide consultancy services. I can help at all stages of software development lifecycle:
- ideas and advice
- design and planning
- development and testing
- deployment and maintenance
- troubleshooting

If youâ€™re a private individual or small business with an interesting project to discuss, it would be great to hear from you.
